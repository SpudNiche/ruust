Messing around with audio manipulation in Rust. Pronounced "roost"?

## Options
Starting out by taking a peek at this list of crates for all things audio: https://lib.rs/multimedia/audio

So far I've played around with the examples from the `creak` and `hound` crates. Next step is to try and apply some homemade filters to modify the incoming samples and see how it changes the output.
