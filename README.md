Messing around with audio manipulation in Rust. Pronounced "roost"?

## Options
Starting out by taking a peek at this list of crates for all things audio: https://lib.rs/multimedia/audio

I've never done any sort of audio file manipulation programmatically, so whatever ends up in this project will be quite simple. At the very least, I want to be able to change some aspect of an audio file (i.e. pitch).
